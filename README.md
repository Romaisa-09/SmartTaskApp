# SmartTaskApp

SmartTaskApp is an Android application built using Java that helps users manage their daily tasks in a simple and organized way. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, categorize them, and filter them based on status or category.

## Features

- Add tasks with a title, description, due date, and category
- Edit and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or pending
- View tasks filtered by status (completed or pending)
- Sort tasks by category
- User profile page for personal details

## How it Works

- When adding a task, the user provides a description, category, and due date.
- The app stores all tasks locally and displays them in a structured list.
- Tasks can be updated or deleted at any time.
- Users can filter tasks by status (completed/pending) or view tasks of a specific category.
- A simple profile page is included for user-related information.
